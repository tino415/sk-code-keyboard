# Keyboard layout for MAC OSX (QWERTY + SK accents)

Classic QWERTY keyboard layout for MAC where Slovak accents are accessible
through `Opt` + key combinations.

Some keys that have multiple accents are mapped to

- `ĺ` - `Opt` + `[`
- `ä` - `Opt` + `]`
- `ô` - `Opt` + `;`

Base for this keyboard was QWERTY keyboard from https://github.com/mathiasbynens/custom.keylayout.
